// the skill attributes of a player depends on two things
// 1) the level of a player
// 2) the position of the player
//
// 1) a rookie player (indendent of the position thry play) would have
// lower skill attributes (and a lower overall rating) compared to pro and legend players
// (indepenedt of the position they play)
